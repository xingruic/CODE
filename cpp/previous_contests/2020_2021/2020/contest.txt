if there are big inputs or outputs, put the line of code down below at the top of main()
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);

REMEMBER:

Don't just use the example input, make your own ones and make sure your program works with all cases!
Get code from CODE/cpp/algorithms to solve faster!

DONT USE FREOPEN!!!!!
